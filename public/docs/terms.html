      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <div class="meta">Effective date: <strong><!-- set a date --> October 14, 2025</strong></div>

      <p>Welcome to Study Advisor. By accessing or using our website and services (“Services”), you agree to these Terms.</p>

      <h2>1) Service Description</h2>
      <p>We help applicants explore US universities/programs and generate Statements of Purpose (SOPs) that can be downloaded as Word files. The universities list is free; SOP generation uses credits.</p>

      <h2>2) Accounts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must provide accurate information and keep your credentials secure.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for activity under your account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate your account or access to the Services if you violate these Terms, misuse the platform, or engage in fraudulent activity. You may also delete your account at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:contact@studyadvisorhub.com">contact@studyadvisorhub.com</a>.</p>


      <h2>4) Credits, Payments & Refunds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Credits are purchased through our payment processor (e.g., Stripe). Taxes may apply.</li>
        <li>Each SOP generation deducts a credit amount shown in-app before purchase.</li>
        <li>Except where required by law, credits are non-refundable once used. If a file cannot be generated or is corrupted, contact us within 7 days and we’ll re-issue the SOP or credit your account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Acceptable Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No scraping, reverse engineering, or misuse of data.</li>
        <li>Do not upload unlawful, infringing, or harmful content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>All site content and software are owned by Study Advisor or its licensors. You receive a personal, non-transferable license to use the Services. You own your account data and generated SOP documents.</p>

      <h2>7) Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>We try to keep program info current, but universities may change requirements at any time. The Service is provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind. Use at your own discretion.</p>

      <h2>8) Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Study Advisor will not be liable for indirect or consequential damages. Our aggregate liability is limited to the amounts you paid to us in the 3 months prior to the event.</p>

      <h2>9) Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Texas for resolving any disputes arising from these Terms or the use of our Services.</p>

      <h2>10) Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms. If changes are material, we’ll notify you in-app or by email. Continued use means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
